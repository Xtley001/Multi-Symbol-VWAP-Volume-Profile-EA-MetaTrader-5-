   * Long: Price above VWAP **and** above HVN/LVN zones.
   * Short: Price below VWAP **and** below HVN/LVN zones.
   * SL = 10% of ADR, TP = 50% of ADR.

3. **Risk & Position Sizing**

   * Position size is calculated from account equity, risk %, and stop-loss distance.

4. **Trade Management**

   * Automated trailing stop logic using **R-multiples**.
   * Optional VWAP crossover exit for early trade closure.

5. **Protections**

   * Stops trading when daily drawdown exceeds limit.
